### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechatronics Enginner and I completed a double major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

I am currently doing a master's in Computer Engineering.

I'm currently working on a real-time control of medical device.

I provide support for the open source projects I like to be better
